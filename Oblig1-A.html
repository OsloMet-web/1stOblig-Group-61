    <p>Different meanings can give discussions. And discussions are
            important, then you can reflect over what you are thinking.
            Here, everyone gets to say what they want to say. And one
            gets to reflect on the matter. With different thoughts and
            opinions, one can arrive at multiple solutions.
            By working in small groups with almost strangers you can get
            the chance to socialize with your colleagues.
            Some cases are easily solved in groups. In small groups you
            can communicate with everyone else in your group and
            share your thoughts on this. It’s easier to communicate with
            each other compared to larger groups</p>
    <p>
    In that case you can talk with the person and tell them to
    sharpen up. Remind them that this is a group work. The
    group itself needs to take some initiative and try to get
    them to join. Try out online meetings or other suitable
    things for the person. The group can also discuss what we
    can do to get this person to participate. If this doesn’t
    work and the person still doesn’t show up or participate
    then we may have to drop this person from the group.
